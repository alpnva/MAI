1 I'm waking up to ash and dust
2 I wipe my brow and sweat my rust
3 I'm breathing in the chemicals
4 I'm breaking in and shaping up
5 Then checking out on the prison bus
6 This is it the apocalypse
7 I'm waking up
8 I feel it in my bones
9 Enough to make my system blow
10 Welcome to the new age
11 To the new age
12 Welcome to the new age
13 To the new age
14 I'm radioactive
15 Radioactive
16 I'm radioactive
17 Radioactive
